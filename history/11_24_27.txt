Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given a list of actions which you can choose one to perform in this turn. You have two choice:
1. Directly output the action in this turn. Output format: Your next action. 
2. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Output format: THOUGHT: Your thoughts. Reminder: The more times you think, the more penalty you retrieve.
After each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. If the environment output "Nothing happened.", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options; if the environment output "OK.", that means you did not do anything to the environment. You have better do action in next step. Last but not least, your output cannot contain "Agent: ".
